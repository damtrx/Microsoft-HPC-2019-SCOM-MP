# Microsoft HPC 2019 SCOM Management Pack

This management pack was "created" because the old HPC 2008 R2 was not working for HPC 2019.

Why MS didn't rewrite their old MP for the new verson is a complete mystery for me. 

## What was changed
1. Few discovery rules
2. Updated discovery scripts
3. Updated rule scripts
4. Fixed DB discovery
5. Renamed everything from 2008 R2 to 2019 :)
   
## TODO
1. Fix DB registry discovery (not needed in my scenario)


Feel free to use this as is.
